     * the target resource, and thus the meaning of AuditEvent.entity.agent is to say that the
     * entity referenced is managed elsewhere and that this Agent provided access to it. This would
     * be similar to where the Entity being referenced is managed outside FHIR, such as through HL7
     * V2, v3, or XDS. This might be where the Entity being referenced is managed in another FHIR
     * resource server. Thus it explains the provenance of that Entity's use in the context of this
     * AuditEvent activity.
