   * resource directly, either because the entity it represents is not available through a FHIR

   * to an actual location. There is no requirement that a Reference.identifier point to something
   * that is actually exposed as a FHIR instance, but it SHALL point to a business concept that
   * would be expected to be exposed as a FHIR instance, and that instance would need to be of a
   * FHIR resource type allowed by the reference.
   *
   * When an identifier is provided in place of a reference, any system processing the reference
   * will only be able to resolve the identifier to a reference if it understands the business
   * context in which the identifier is used. Sometimes this is global (e.g. a national identifier)
   * but often it is not. For this reason, none of the useful mechanisms described for working with
   * references (e.g. chaining, includes) are possible, nor should servers be expected to be able
   * resolve the reference. Servers may accept an identifier based reference untouched, resolve it,
   * and/or reject it - see CapabilityStatement.rest.resource.referencePolicy.
   *
   * When both an identifier and a literal reference are provided, the literal reference is
   * preferred. Applications processing the resource are allowed - but not required - to check that
   * the identifier matches the literal reference
   *
   * Applications converting a logical reference to a literal reference may choose to leave the
   * logical reference present, or remove it.
   *
   * Reference is intended to point to a structure that can potentially be expressed as a FHIR
   * resource, though there is no need for it to exist as an actual FHIR resource instance - except
   * in as much as an application wishes to actual find the target of the reference. The content
   * referred to be the identifier must meet the logical constraints implied by any limitations on
   * what resource types are permitted for the reference. For example, it would not be legitimate to
   * send the identifier for a drug prescription if the type were
   * Reference(Observation|DiagnosticReport). One of the use-cases for Reference.identifier is the
   * situation where no FHIR representation exists (where the type is Reference (Any).
