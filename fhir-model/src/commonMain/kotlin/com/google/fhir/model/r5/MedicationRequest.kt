   * precedence: e.g. give drug "abc" followed by drug "def" e.g. give drug 30 minutes before some
   * procedure was performed more generically this supports - hierarchical groups of actions, where
   * each specific action references the action to be performed (in terms of a Request resource),
   * and each group describes additional behavior, relationships, and applicable conditions between
   * the actions in the overall group. Note that one should NOT use the List or Composition resource
