     * strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
     * implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be
     * met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are
     * required to check for modifier extensions.
     *
     * Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource or
     * DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension itself).
     *
     * There can be no stigma associated with the use of extensions by any application, project, or
     * standard - regardless of the institution or jurisdiction that uses or defines the extensions.
     * The use of extensions is what allows the FHIR specification to retain a core level of
     * simplicity for everyone.
